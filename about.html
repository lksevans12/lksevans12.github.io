        <p>Hi and welcome to my page! I'm a 23-year-old aspiring web developer who currently lives in NYC! I was born in Guatemala and adopted when I was 8 months old, so I am very grateful for the opportunities I have been given. I got my degree from DePaul University in 2014. I have a B.A. in Communications and Media, and a minor in Journalism. I am currently attending Dev Botocamp to become a junior web developer. </p>

        <p> My interest in becoming a web developer began in the beginning of 2015. I took a few classes on HTML and CSS, and decided that I wanted and needed to know more. While I am passionate about my BA field, I know that coding is what I want to do -- I have never been so sure! In addition to coding I like knitting, reading, and bagpipes.  </p>
