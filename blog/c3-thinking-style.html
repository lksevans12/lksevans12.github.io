      Concrete allows learners to register information through the five senses. When using concrete ability, you are focused in the present and see everything the way they are. Random allows your mind to organize information through trucks and in no order -- meaning you can skip steps and will get get the desired result. They also like to work in the spur of the moment rather than planned. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Concrete random learners like to experiment to find answers. They are independent, take risks, and use intuition. They have a hard time following routines, keeping detailed records, and having no options. 
    </p>
   
    <p>
      They also like to try new approaches to solving problems, create their own asnwers, love to brainstorm, and enjoy hands on experiences. Many of these traits are similar to the traits of a growth mindset. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The growth mindset states that intelligence can be devloped. Someone with a growth mindset desires to learn, embrace challenges, learn from feedback and criticism and have a greate sense of free will. 
      </p>
    <p>
      After doing research, I feel I can say that I am a concrete random leaner with a growth mindset. I enjoy trying new approaches to problems, creating my own projects and using my own designs. I learn better when using hands on experience, and I have a desire to learn.
