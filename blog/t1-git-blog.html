      Git is a version-controlled software. Version control is a software that records your changes to a file so that you can revisit different versions later. You can also compare changes over time, and see changes or issues from other people. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Git helps you keep track of changes by saving any changes to your project. Git will tell you what changes you've made to all files, and allows to reset or commit them. Git can also show you all the changes youve made overtime, and you can go back to previous editions of the file. You can also work on various branches, and merge with the master branch when ready. 
    </p>

      GitHub is an open source software, which means that developers are free to use and customize the software to their needs. In addition, developers can pull and merge their idea with other peoples files (with their permission of course.)  Developers should use GitHub to store code to track their commits, not only so they can see what changes were made, but also so other people can give feedback and update projects as needed. GitHub is basically an open datatbase for programmers to share ideas and projects.
