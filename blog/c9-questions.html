    <p> Sometimes I write or ask great questions -- questions that make you think, "damn, how did she know to ask that"? Sometimes I write  or ask HORRIBLE questions -- questions that make you think, "damn, does that girl even know what she's talking about"? </p>

    <p> Researching how to write a great question taught me a lot I had never thought of. When I write questions now, I write it as if I was asking a friend. Based on past questions, I feel I could've given more inofrmation about what I've already tried, and my ultimate goal. I've also never really though about grammar and puncuation when writing a question, but now I will always make sure my questions are tailored to get the best answers.  </p>

    <p> There have been some questions on the Google + community that I have been confused about, and I remember thinking that I would've liked some more information. I liked that the readings suggested writing questions from the mindset of someone whom might read the question. </p>

    <p> Overall, I am glad that we had to research how to ask good questions. I will keep the tips and tricks I learned through researrch in mind when I am asking a question in person or online. In order to recieve the best answer, I need to make sure my questions are clear, knowledgable and expressive. Any questions? </p>
