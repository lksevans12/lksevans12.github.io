    <p> Stereotype threat refers to identifying oneself with a negative stereo type about a certain group. It is the threat of being viewed though the lens of a negative stereotype and doing something that would confirm that stereotype, or as Dr. Claude Steele says, subconscious self-handicapping. According to <a href ="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/consequences.html"> Reducing Stereotype Threat</a>, "stereotype threat can harm performance on any task where a stereotype is invoked suggesting that members of some groups will perform more poorly than others."</p>

    <p> Many texts give the example of Black students doing poorly on tests or in educational environments because negative stereotypes are embedded in their thoughts. However, stereotype threat can affect anyone and can decrease performance on any kind of task. </p>

    <p> Since I was a baby, I've always suffered from some kind of identity crisis. I was adopted from Guatemala when I was 8 months old, by a single mother. Guatemala, as you may or may not know, is a 3rd world or developing country. It is one of the poorest countries in Latin America. However, I live in NYC, in an affluent area. Although I was raised in this area, I still have parts of my culture in my blood. However, since I am legally Hispanic, my friends, peers and myself identify me as white. So you see, my problem is that I don't identify with either culture. I don't know anything about my origin's culture, and my environmental cultural seems fake to me. </p>

    <p> The stereotype for Hispanics and that most of us are illegal, if not our parents are. We come to America not speaking any English, and for the most part are only able to get low paying labor jobs. Our future in America is limited by our status.</p>

    <p> When people meet me, they either think Iâ€™m Hispanic or that I'm white. There is usually no in-between. I found that while I was reading about stereotype threat, I thought to myself as Hispanic. As a Hispanic woman, I am nervous about not succeeding, and being intimated by people with more talent and skill. Also, I am nervous that not being as confident in my background will affect my work.</p>

    <p> I've never experienced stereotype threat, I've always felt pretty comfortable with my abilities and in my environment. However, if I had not been adopted into a privileged family, I can imagine stereotype threat would be present on many occasions. I'm sure its extremely difficult to feel constrained by something so negative. I'm sure its hard to move past, to gain back the confidence lost by the arrogance of others.  </p>

    <p> At DBC, I plan to stay confident about my abilities, skills, and talents. We're all at different skills, but we all have different talents and ways of thinking. In some of my pairing sessions, my partner and I have each come up with different ways of doing the problem, both correct, just different opinions and thinking styles. If I ever feel myself focusing too much on negative stereotypes, I will re-read this post, and remember that we're all here for the same reason.</p>
