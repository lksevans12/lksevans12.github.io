    <p>Growing up with progressive education, group projects have always been a big part of our learning, so I'm somewhat used to working in a team and being able to communicate affectively. The part that I found difficult about DBC pairing is that everybody is at a different level of knowledge, so we are all at a different place, and it can be very intimidating sometimes. It can be rewarding as well becuase I am learning the technique, logic, and knowledge of another person, and it is always great to have other sources of knowledge. It can also be frustrating </p>

    <p> Reading my feedback from my pairing sessions was very interesting. In many of my pairing sessions, I was very nervous, and thought that my nervousness would mask my knowledge of the material and curriculum. However, according to my feedback, it didnt -- which was rewarding to read. I already knew that I needed to work on my driving. For me, driving makes me very nervous becuase I want all my code to be correct and for it to make sense to my partner. I get passive becuase I am nervous that I am not giving the write code or that the other person is more knowledgable than I am, and would be able to tackle the problem with ease.  </p>

    <p> I believe that my feedback was helpful to my learning. Although I already knew the bit about driving, it gave me confidence to read that I am up to date with the materials, which gave me more condience to drive. Based on my feedback, I have tried to be better at driving. I always warn my partner that my feedback states that my driving skills need work, so that is something I am constantly trying to improve. </p>

    <p> Writing feedback was also difficult. The biggest thing for me was writing the improvement section. I found that I have always learned something new from my pairing sesion, so it was hard for me to point out improvements when they helped improve me. I found though, that most of my comments were on pace and making sure that the partner understand. There were a few times in my pairing session where I felt my pair was moving on quickly after we finished the code without explanation. Although I asked them about it and did research, for the future they should be aware that everything needs to be explained to one another. </p>

    <p> Overall, I really enjoy the idea of using pairing and giving feedback. I think using two totally different developed minds solving one problem is a great idea. Not only does it allow you to see the problem from a different view, but it also allows you to gain new techniques, knowledge and ideas about hwo to solve the problem. I also really enjoy the feedback aspect of pairing. I think getting feedback from a person who saw you in your groove, who saw you using your techniques and how you work with a pair is extrememly beneficial to any learning. I always try to grow from my feedback, and hope that my partners grow from the feedback I've given them.</p>
