      At DBC, everyone is in it together, you have to be excited, motivated, ready to work together and be caring towards and about others. I know that the work will be hard, but I also know that it will be exciting to learn. I really enjoyed the idea that Shereef shared about the way the admissions staff and experienced developers viewed us. Although we all have different backgrounds, we are generally at the same level of coding -- we know nothing. It's great knowing that we're all here to learn and grow together. I think that if we all just go in there excited and motivated to learn, that we'll rock.

     Although my expectations of DBC hasn't changed, I think week 1 of phase 0 really helped understand what's expected of us. I really like that we have to reflect on most challenges and that we really get to know our cohort members. I am very excited to participate in this kind of learning environment. I'm ready to be pushed and to learn. The two things that make me nervous are knowing that the work will get harder and the hours. I'm nervous that I'm going to feel overwhelmbed, but I know that if I work on techniques, finding my zone and time management that I'll have an easier time. Looking forward to working with you all!
