      In this section, I will be explaining two concepts of ruby: arrays and hashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      An array is a container that holds objects such as integers or strings. An array is formated like: ["today", "tomorrow", "yesterday"] or [1,6,3,9]. The brackets suggest that the element is an array.<br> <br>Arrays are numbered a little differently. For example, lets say we have this bracket array = ["today", "tomorrow", "yesterday", "never"] -- okay? You would think that "today" would be in position 1 -- WRONG!! Array positions are numbered starting from 0....so "today" is at 0, "yesterday" is at 1. Through this system, I can easily find the position of an object in the array by putting arrary[3] = ["never"]. <br><br>You can also keep track of the length of an array. To do this, you put array.length. Since there are 4 objects in my array, the output would be 4. You can also see if there is a certain object in that array. To do this, you can put array.include?("forever"). Since I do not have "forever" in my array, it would say false. <br><br> It is also easy to add an item to an array. Using .push adds the object to the end. To do this, you put. array.push("forever") which would produce array = ["today", "tomorrow", "yesterday", "never", "forever"]. However, you can also add anywhere in the array. You can put array.inset(3, "now", "later") which would produce array = ["today", "tomorrow", "yesterday","now","later", "never", "forever"]. The list of methods that can be applied to arrays is extensive, I have only included a few examples. You can find out more about arrays here: <a href ="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html">Ruby Doc: Array</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       Another similar concept to arrays is hashes. A hash is a container that holds unique keys and their values. Jeys can be anything such as integers, strings or symbols, however they must be unique to the hash they belong to. Hashes position their values in the order that the keys were inserted. For example: my_info = {
        :first_name =>"Laura",
        :last_name =>"Evans",
        :hometown=>"NYC",
        :age=>23
          }  is a hash. Hashes are use to represent date structures, and as a way to have named parameters in functions. Similar to arrays, there are many different methods that can be applied to hashes. You can find out more about hashes here: <a href ="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html">Ruby Doc: Hash</a>
