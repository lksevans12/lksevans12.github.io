      In CSS positioning, there are 4 main ways to position an element. They are normal flow (static), absolute, fixed and relative. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The first position property is normal flow. In code, it is written like : <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_position"> position: static </a>.However, normal flow is the way that browers treat HTML elemts, so you do not need to add position to the CSS stylesheet. Normal flow is also not affected by box offset elements such as top, bottom, left or right. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The next position property is absolute. In code it is written: <a href ="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_position&preval=absolute">position: absolute</a>. When using the absolute position, the element is taken out of normal flow. It not longer affects the position of other elements on the page -- basically, the other elments act like the element isnt there. In order to get the positioning the way you want it, you need to use box offset elements  such as top, bottom, left or right. Absolute positioning also moves with the scroll of the webpage. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The next position property is relative. In code, it is written like:<a href= "http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_position&preval=relative"> position: relative.</a> Relative positioning moves the element in relation to where it would've been in normal flow. In order to get the positioning you want, you need to use box offset elements  such as top, bottom, left or right to indicated how far to move the element from where it would've been in normal flow. Relative positioning can overlap other elements. It is oftern used as container blocks. 
      </p>
    <p>
      The last position property is fixed. In code, it is written like: <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_position&preval=fixed">position: fixed.</a> Fixed positioning moves elements in relation to the browser widow. It can overlap other elements. Fixed position stays in the same place while scrolling on a webpage. In order to get the positioning the way you want it, you need to use box offset elements  such as top, bottom, left or right. It does not affect the position of surrounding elements and is removed from normal flow.
