    <p><h2> My values:</h2> <br><br>
    In general, I try to live up to these values:

Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
</p><br>
    <ul>
    <li>achievement,4</li>
    <li>accountability,5</li>
    <li>adventure.3</li>
    <li>ambition,5</li>
    <li>challenge,3</li>
    <li>commitment,5</li>
    <li>community,4</li>
    <li>compassion,5</li>
    <li>creativity,5</li>
    <li>enthusiasm,5</li>
    <li>excitement, 4</li>
    <li>faith, 5</li>
    <li>friendships, 4</li>
    <li>growth, 5</li>
    <li>helping others & society, 5</li>
    <li>independence, 3</li>
    <li>inspiration, 4</li>
    <li>integrity, 5</li>
    <li>leadership, 4</li>
    <li>loyalty, 5</li>
    <li>persistence, 4</li>
    <li>personal development, 4</li>
    <li>quality,5</li>
    <li>responsibility,5</li>
    <li>self-knowledge,5,</li>
    <li>self-reliance,5</li>
    <li>self-respect,5</li>
  </ul>

  <p> All of the values above are or have been important to me recently. Since starting DBC, I've found that some of these values are more present than others.<p>

  <p> Most recently, I've found a lot of value and meaning in self-reliance. Self reliance is reliance on one's own capabilities, judgement, resources, and decisions. DBC has brought out this value for me. I've found that I've become more dependent on myself, and on my skills. There have been points in challenges, where I don't know what to do, or how to do it, or even if I can do it. I've found that the more I believe in my skills, in my decisions. Self-reliance is important, becuase I need to be able to rely on myself, especially when I get myself down. Withouth self-reliance, I wouldn't be able to grow as a person, or believe in myself. </p>

  <p>The last topic someone asked my advice on had to do with personal development, which is one of my values. A good friend of mine needed advice on how to get better or make himself feel better. He was having serioous doubts about himself, and I gave him advice on personal growth. In order to feel better, get stronger, you need to focus on your growth. If you focus on what's getting you down, you won't be able to grow. The only way to feel better is to grow. </p>

  <p> My values are what make me the person I am today. While most of my values are good and help me reach my potential, some of them are destructive and require the other values to grow. Like I said before, DBC has helped make some of these values more present. I totally believe that if I were to feel stereotype threat, that my values would help mediate it, and help me get out of that funk. They do it for me at home when its my own self destroying my confidence and abilities, so I know they will help if opinions of others invaid my head as well. </p>
