    <p> Recently, I've been feeling behind at DBC, and my feedback from GPS has shown it. My hours at work have been increasing, and I haven't been focusing much time on important relationships. My last day of work was supposed to August 13th, in about a week. However, due to my recent feedback and my need to figure out my life before I start DBC, made me feel like I needed to quit my job early. HOWEVER! A girl quit last week, and another girl was on vacation, and I knew me quitting now would be the worst possible time for the company, and of course, being the person I am, I felt horrible. Now, I had only worked at this company for about 2-3 months, but still felt accountable and responsible to them. </p>

    <p> I didn't want to leave them without being able to cover my shift, but I knew that I wouldn't be able to come in every day this week in order to catch up with the materials im behind on, and also to make sure im up to date this week.</p>
   
   <p> I was very conflicted becuase I didn't want to leave the company without any backup, especially since they were already short staffed. I was upset becuase when I approached them, they wouldn't work with my on the scheduling. Overall, I was upset becuase I was so conflicted about what todo. </p>

   <p>I tried speaking to management, explaining that I was behind in some of my schoool work, and needed to take 2 days off to fully immerse myself in the materials and resources. They said that they couldn't do that, however they could shorten my hours -- which was nice and considerate of them. However, this was before I came home on Monday and read that the release said we would need to really invest time in the materials. So, the next day, I told them that I really needed the two days off, and they still said no, but they could shorten my hours. However, shortening my hours does nothing. Including transportation, the whole day cost me 7 hours, where I could've been working on DBC materials. </p>

   <p> If I could go back and do something differently, I would stick up for myself more. The company will move on whether or not I'm there, and my future won't wait forever. In the end, I ended up quitting the same day becuase they no longer understood my needs. Although it was only a week early, I still feel badly about leaving them short handed, however, I know that I did the best thing for my future and for my successs at DBC. </p>

  <p> This experience taught me that although decisions are hard, you need to do what's best for you. When you become accountable and responsible to something, its hard to let that go, and thats where I was struggling. I knew it was time for me to go, however, I wanted to do what was in the best interest of both parties. </p>
