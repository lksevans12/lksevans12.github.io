        My interest in programming began in 2014. I took a basic IT/Web class in college, and found it truly interesting.  For my senior capstone project, I chose to build a website for a small head hunting firm. However, since I took a very basic class and my skills were extremely limited, I was unable to build a fully functioning website, and instead, built a basic mockup based on the client&#39s needs. <br><br>

        In June 2014, I graduated from DePaul University with a BA in Communication and Media, with a minor in Journalism. Shortly after I graduated, my family had an emergency, and required me to stay home full-time. Boredom shortly struck, and I began taking beginner-programming classes to keep myself busy. After the first intro to HTML/CSS class I took with <a id = "links" href = "https://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a>, I realized programming was something that I wanted to pursue. I began attending more classes with <a id = "links" href = "https://www.girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It (GDI)</a>, and was introduced to <a id = "links" href = "http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp (DBC)</a>.<br><br>

        As of Dec 2015, I am a graduate of DBC and a certified junior web developer. <br><br>
